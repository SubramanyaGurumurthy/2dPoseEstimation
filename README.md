# RealTimeHandGestureDetection

## Volume Control
In this module, user can control the device's volume using hand gesutre. Basically in this module, the program detects hand using MediaPipe library, within which, the tip of the index finger and tip of the thumb is recognised and used further for controlling the volume. The volume increases as the user elongates the length between tip of index finger and thumb, and volume decreases as the user decreases it.
